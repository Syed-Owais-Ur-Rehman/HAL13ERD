```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Install **pipx** to install ghunt:
```
cd $HOME
pip3 install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install ghunt
```

First, launch the listener by doing `ghunt login` and choose between 1 of the 2 first methods :

> [!TIP]
> **Option 1** is recommended as it is easier method for gmail login.

```
$ ghunt login

[1] (Companion) Put GHunt on listening mode
[2] (Companion) Paste base64-encoded cookies
[3] Enter manually all cookies

Choice =>
```


Then, use GHunt Companion to complete the login.
